# Coalesce

Coalesce your backlinked notes into a single view.

## Description:

Inspired by Roam, Logseq, Influx, OneNote's Quick Notes, and Obsidian's Backlinks in Document feature.

## Features
- Replace Obsidian's Backlinks in Document with a more comprehensive and configurable view.
- Use Note aliases to further narrow the view.

## Getting Started
1. Enable Daily Notes or even better, use the Streams Plugin.
2. Take notes in a daily note.
3. Add a backlink above your text block.
4. Add a --- linebreak below the text block that you created.
5. Coalesce will now show the backlinked note in a single view by navigating to the backlinked file and entering view mode (not edit).

## Theory
This plugin exists because it's not always realistic to sort and organize quick notes into folder heirarchies when in the moment or under duress. It's better to jot down notes into a daily note stream quickly and backlink it at leisure. Howerver, the quick notes collected must still be viewable, comprehensive, and findable in a quick and easy way.
