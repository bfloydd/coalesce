# Coalesce

Coalesce your notes into a single view.

## Description:

Inspired by Roam, Logseq, Influx, OneNote's Quick Notes, and obsidian's Backlinks in Document feature.

## Theory
This plugin exists because it's not always realistic to sort and organize quick notes into folder heirarchies when in the moment or under duress. It's better to jot down notes into a daily note stream quickly and backlink it at leisure. Howerver, the quick notes collected must still be vieable in a single and easy way.

## Getting Started
1. Enable Daily Notes or even better, use the Streams Plugin.
2. Take notes in a daily note.
3. Add a backlink above your text block.
4. Coalesce will now show the backlinked note in a single view by navigating to the backlinked file. You might also need to be in obsidian view mode.

## Thoughts
- I typically see two types of notes:
    1. A log on a topic.
    2. A formatted document.

- On logs: Coalesce is designed to work with the first type of note, which might be a project, a technology, a philosophical topic, book notes, etc. 80-95% of the time I spend in Obsidian is spent logging this type of note.

## How It Works
1. **Take Notes Freely**: Capture ideas in daily notes or any other note stream.
2. **Link Together**: Use backlinks to connect related thoughts and aliases to make it easy.
3. **View in Coalesce**: See all related content together in one organized document.
