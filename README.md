# Coalesce Plugin for Obsidian

## Description:

Coalesce notes into a single view. Brings all your linked notes into a single view, creating a cohesive document out of scattered thoughts. Same idea as Obsidian's <i>backlinks in document</i> feature. The goal is to take notes as quickly as possible without worrying about up front organization. Take the note in your Daily Note, then Backlink it. Bypass thinking about folder heirarchices while taking notes.

## Thoughts
- I typically see two types of notes:
    1. A log on a topic.
    2. A formatted document.

- On logs: Coalesce is designed to work with the first type of note, which might be a project, a technology, a philosophical topic, book notes, etc. 80-95% of the time I spend in Obsidian is spent logging this type of note.

## How It Works
1. **Take Notes Freely**: Capture ideas in daily notes or any other note stream.
2. **Link Together**: Use backlinks to connect related thoughts and aliases to make it easy.
3. **View in Coalesce**: See all related content together in one organized document.
