# Coalesce Plugin for Obsidian

## Description:

Coalesce is an Obsidian plugin that brings all your linked notes into one view, creating a cohesive document out of your scattered thoughts. Like Obsidian's <i>backlinks in document</i> feature but with enhanced structure and a polished look.

## Thoughts
- I typically see two types of notes:
    1. A log on a topic.
    2. A formatted document.

- On logs: Coalesce is designed to work with the first type of note, which might be a project, a technology, a philosophical topic, book notes, etc. 80-95% of the time many of us spend in Obsidian is spent logging this type of note, the other 5-20% is spent creating formatted documents for presentations, blog posts, etc. Is this you?

- On logging: The goal is to take notes as freely as possible, without worrying about organization up front and in the moment. To bypass thinking about deep folder heirarchices while taking notes. To have a place to hit and dump thoughts without interupting your flow or who you might be listening or talking to. Get it down, let organization happen. If you use OneNote, Notion, Evernote, Apple Notes, etc. mostly require you to organize up front. Onenote has Quick Notes, though that create an inbox, a bucket to deal with later. Ugh. Can we just take notes?

## How It Works
- **Take Notes Freely**: Capture ideas in daily notes or any other note stream. I recommend using Streams Plugin also.
- **Link Together**: Use backlinks to connect related thoughts and aliases to make it easy.
- **View in Coalesce**: See all related content together in one organized document.
