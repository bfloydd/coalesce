# Coalesce

Coalesce your notes into a single view.

## Description:

Inspired by Roam, Logseq, Influx, OneNote's Quick Notes, and Obsidian's "Backlinks in document" feature.

This plugin addresses:
1. The challenge of taking quick notes when immediate sorting into folder hierarchies is not feasible.
2. Later finding and viewing those notes in a single view.

## Features
- Replace Obsidian's Backlinks in Document with a more comprehensive and configurable view.
- Use aliases and filtering to further narrow the view.

## Getting Started
1. Enable daily notes, or even better, use the Streams Plugin.
2. Take notes in a daily note.
3. Add a backlink above your text block.
4. Add a --- linebreak below the text block.
5. Navigate to the backlinked file.
6. Enter view mode.
