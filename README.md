# Obsidian Coalesce

## Description

Coalesce is a plugin for Obsidian that reassembles your backlinks into a single document.
This is simlar to "Show backlinks at the bottom of notes" that is a standard feature in Obsidian,
but we make it look nicer and make some assumptions about the structure of your notes.

Go on..
1. Take notes wrecklessly in daily notes (or wherever), then add backlinks..
2. Let the backlinks guide your research and writing.
3. Now view it all together in Coalesce, as one.

## How to use

1. Add and enable the plugin.
2. Open today's daily note and backlink another note.
3. Open that note and look below.

## Notes
- Don't show on daily notes.
- Only shows in view mode.
